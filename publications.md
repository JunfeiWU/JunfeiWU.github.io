# In summary

Since my second year of college, I have been involved in scientific research projects. In the early stages of
my academic career, I primarily conducted simple studies on the temporal and spatial distribution characteristics of
environmental factors such as sand particle size and avalanche events, based on fieldwork observations and remote
sensing imagery. During my graduate studies, I utilized remote sensing data and numerical simulation models to conduct
more quantitative research on the temporal and spatial distribution characteristics of water resource elements.

## Projects

### 2018: Research on the microscopic causes of land subsidence in the mountain-cutting areas of the Loess Plateau—taking Lanzhou New District as an example

Funded by National Undergraduate Training Program for Innovation and Enterpreneurship (Funding Amount: $200)

- Experimental conclusion: Compared with the natural area, the deep loess in the fill area has a more broken and sparse
  structure, a higher moisture content, weaker soil structural stability, and greater collapsibility of the loess.

### 2016: Preliminary Study on Dynamic Characteristics of Grain Size Distribution in Surface Sediments of Tengger Desert

Funded by Field practice ability improvement project at Lanzhou University Geography Base（Funding Amount: $2,000）

- In order to understand the relationship between spatial characteristic of surface sediments particle size and wind
  system in the Tengger Desert. Surface layer samples of desert were collected. After careful particle size measurement,
  the particle size was interpolated by IDW spatial interpolation. Based on modern wind observations and Google images,
  the spatial distribution of surface sediment particle size of Tengger Desert is preliminarily understood. There is a
  clear consistency between the spatial distribution of sand dune surface grain size and the prevailing surface winds in
  the desert. The east and west of the desert show the decreasing trend of particle size from NE to SW and from NW to
  SE, and the low value areas of NE, SW and NW margin areas are caused by multi winds, vegetation and regional
  topography respectively. Although the analysis result is limited by the sampling density, it generally reflects the
  control of the wind system on the surface sediment particle size of the dunes, and also indirectly reflects the main
  source of the Tengger Desert material, the alluvial fan of Shiyang River and the alluvial and diluvial fan of Helan
  Mountains. (Manuscript)
