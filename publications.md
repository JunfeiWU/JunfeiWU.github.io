# In summary

Since my second year of college, I have been involved in scientific research projects. In the early stages of
my academic career, I primarily conducted simple studies on the temporal and spatial distribution characteristics of
environmental factors such as sand particle size and avalanche events, based on fieldwork observations and remote
sensing imagery.

During my graduate studies, Arthur Lutz and Sonu Khanal trained me on how to use the SPHY model, which sparked my
interest in remote sensing technology and numerical modeling. Consequently, I embarked on a research project to study
snow depth using various remote sensing data and machine learning algorithms during my graduate years.

## Projects

### 2018: Research on the microscopic causes of land subsidence in the mountain-cutting areas of the Loess Plateau—taking Lanzhou New District as an example (Funding Amount: $200)

Funded by National Undergraduate Training Program for Innovation and Enterpreneurship 

- Experimental conclusion: Compared with the natural area, the deep loess in the fill area has a more broken and sparse
  structure, a higher moisture content, weaker soil structural stability, and greater collapsibility of the loess.

### 2016: Preliminary Study on Dynamic Characteristics of Grain Size Distribution in Surface Sediments of Tengger Desert（Funding Amount: $2,000）

Funded by Field practice ability improvement project at Lanzhou University Geography Base
